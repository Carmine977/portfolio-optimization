# portfolio-optimization

## Overview

This project solves an optimization problem to find the right allocation of N stocks of a portfolio that maximizes the expected return for a given risk level. 
The approach is inspired by the **Machine Learning for Trading course** of Georgia Tech Institute distributed through [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud501) 


## Contents

Given a set of N stocks, whose data are availbale in provided csv files, the code use the *scipy* optimization library to calculate the optimal percentage of each stock in the portfolio to get an optimal return over the time period considered. 


## Usage

Run this code using [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Just type `jupyter notebook` in the main directory and the code will pop up in a browser window.
